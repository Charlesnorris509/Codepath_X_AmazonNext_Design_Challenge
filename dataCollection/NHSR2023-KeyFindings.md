# Key Findings on Diagnosed Dementia Prevalence

## Overall Prevalence
- The overall prevalence of diagnosed dementia in adults aged 65 and older is not explicitly stated in the provided table. However, it can be inferred to be around **3.9%**, as the midpoint of a range of **2.8%-4.9%** mentioned in the technical notes section of the report. This is likely a weighted average.

## Age
- The table does not show age-specific prevalence, but the technical notes discuss trends by age group.

## Race/Ethnicity
- **Hispanic:** 6.1% (4.6-8.1)
- **Black Non-Hispanic:** 7.7% (5.4-10.7)
- **White Non-Hispanic:** 3.0% (2.3-3.8)

## Education Level
- **Less than a high school diploma:** 8.9% (6.4-12.1)
- **High school diploma or GED:** 5.5% (4.2-7.2)
- **Some college:** 3.8% (2.8-5.2)
- **Bachelor's degree or more:** 1.6% (1.1-2.3)
  
The data suggests an inverse relationship between education level and diagnosed dementia prevalence.

## Family Income (as a percentage of the Federal Poverty Level - FPL)
- **Less than 100% FPL:** 8.8% (6.7-11.3)
- **100% to less than 200% FPL:** 5.0% (3.9-6.2)
- **200% to less than 400% FPL:** 5.0% (3.9-6.2)
- **400% or more FPL:** 2.6% (1.9-3.4)

There is a strong relationship between income and diagnosed dementia prevalence, with a higher percentage among individuals below the poverty line.

## Urbanization Level
- **Large central metropolitan:** 3.3% (2.4-4.5)
- **Large fringe metropolitan:** 4.2% (3.2-5.5)
- **Medium and small metropolitan:** 4.8% (3.8-5.9)
- **Nonmetropolitan:** 3.5% (2.5-4.7)

Diagnosed dementia prevalence is slightly higher in medium and small metropolitan areas.

## Region
- **Northeast:** 4.7% (3.4-6.4)
- **Midwest:** 3.7% (2.7-4.9)
- **South:** 4.2% (3.4-5.3)
- **West:** 3.5% (2.5-4.7)

The Northeast has the highest prevalence rate of diagnosed dementia.

## Proxy Respondent
- **Yes (Proxy):** 38.2% (31.9-44.8)
- **No (Self):** 2.3% (1.9-2.8)

When a proxy respondent is used, the prevalence is much higher, suggesting potential bias when someone else reports the diagnosis.

## Mode of Interview
- **Telephone (all or some):** 3.7% (3.0-4.5)
- **In person:** 4.4% (3.7-5.2)

## Important Notes
- **Statistical Significance:** Differences between subgroups were evaluated using statistical tests. Terms like "more likely" or "less likely" indicate a significant difference.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Each percentage is followed by a 95% confidence interval, showing the range in which the true population value is likely to fall.
- **Data Source:** The data comes from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 2022, representing the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population.
- **Technical Notes:** Variables like family income, urbanization level, and region are defined and categorized in the technical notes.

## Summary
The data suggests that diagnosed dementia prevalence is higher among certain groups, including Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic adults, those with lower education levels, those with incomes below the poverty line, individuals living in metropolitan areas outside city centers, and those in the Northeast region. A large difference in prevalence was observed when a proxy respondent was used, and a slight difference was noted between telephone and in-person interviews.
