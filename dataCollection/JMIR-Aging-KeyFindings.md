# Study Overview

## I. Study Overview

- **Focus**: The study investigates how individuals with memory concerns (PWMCs) and their caregivers (CGs) in the U.S. used technology during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
- **Context**: The pandemic led to increased social isolation and physical distancing, making technology a potential tool for maintaining connections and managing daily life.  
- **Participants**: The study included 20 PWMCs and 20 CGs. Most PWMCs lived with their CGs, and many were family members. The sample was primarily White non-Hispanic, highly educated, and had a median income higher than the national average.

## II. Participant Demographics

- **Age**: The mean age was 72.23 years, ranging from 37 to 88 years.  
- **Race**: 95% of participants were White.  
- **Ethnicity**: 97.5% were non-Hispanic.  
- **Gender**: 50% were female and 50% were male.  
- **Education**: Most participants had a bachelor's degree or higher.  
- **Employment**: Most caregivers were retired.  
- **PWMC Diagnoses**: Half of PWMCs had Alzheimer's or early-onset Alzheimer's, 30% had mild cognitive impairment, and the remainder had other types of memory loss.

## III. Technology Use

- **Types of Technology**: Participants used smartphones, smartwatches, computers, tablets, smart TVs, and assistive technologies (e.g., pill dispensers).  
- **Mainstream vs. Assistive**: Mainstream technologies (smartphones, Zoom) were predominantly used.  
- **Impact of COVID-19**: The pandemic led to an increase in technology use among many participants.

## IV. Key Themes Identified

The qualitative analysis identified three main groups of themes:

### Facilitators of Technology Use
1. **Sustaining Social Connections**: Technology helped maintain contact with family and friends during isolation (e.g., video calls, texting).  
2. **Reducing Boredom**: Technology provided entertainment and engagement (e.g., online games, streaming services, internet browsing).  
3. **Increasing Caregiver Respite**: Technology helped manage caregiving tasks (e.g., scheduling apps, GPS tracking devices) and potentially created time for caregiver respite.

## V. Discussion and Implications

- **Importance of Technology**: The study emphasizes the importance of technology for PWMCs and CGs, particularly during isolation.  
- **Mainstream Technology Usage**: The finding that mainstream technologies are primarily used is significant.  
- **Need for User-Centered Design**: The importance of codesign of technology with PWMCs and CGs is highlighted, particularly focusing on technology specifically designed for individuals with memory concerns.  
- **Future Research**: The authors recommend further research to understand how mainstream technologies are used to support PWMCs and CGs, and to compare coping outcomes between those who increased technology use and those who did not.

## VI. Limitations

- **Recruitment Bias**: Participants were recruited via email and had to be willing to use Zoom, leading to potential selection bias.  
- **Demographic Limitations**: The sample was highly educated, primarily White, non-Hispanic, and had higher incomes than national averages.  
- **Exclusion of Certain Groups**: The study did not include PWMCs in long-term care or those in the later stages of dementia, thus limiting generalizability.

## VII. Conclusion

- **Pandemic Impact**: The COVID-19 pandemic increased technology use among participants.  
- **Technology Benefits**: Technology helped alleviate isolation, provided caregiver relief, and afforded PWMCs more independence.  
- **Future Directions**: The study suggests the need for more inclusive research involving diverse populations.

## VIII. Acknowledgements & Conflicts of Interest

- **Funding**: The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging.  
- **Conflicts of Interest**: The authors have no financial interest in the study.

In summary, this study highlights the role of technology in the lives of persons with memory concerns and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that technology can help alleviate isolation, provide entertainment, and offer respite for caregivers. However, more research is needed to understand these dynamics across a wider range of individuals and circumstances, especially in regards to a more diverse group of participants in future research.
