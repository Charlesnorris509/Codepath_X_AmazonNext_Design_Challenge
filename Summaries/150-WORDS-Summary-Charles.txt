Our project focuses on Brenda Pope, a 72-year-old retired teacher and avid music lover. Like many seniors, Margaret enjoys using Spotify but faces challenges navigating its complex interface due to cognitive changes and memory issues.
We identified her problem through user interviews, where seniors shared difficulties recalling song names, creating playlists, and navigating apps with cluttered designs.

To address these challenges, we redesigned Spotify with thoughtful features, including a "Memory Vault" for tagging favorite songs by mood or events, voice recognition, and a "humming" feature to identify songs without precise details.
Wireframes highlight an accessible interface with larger buttons, uncluttered menus, and mood-based playlists, prioritizing simplicity and usability.

Our design is also 508-compliant, ensuring accessibility for users with varying abilities.
By incorporating features like voice commands, visual clarity, and intuitive navigation, our solution meets federal accessibility standards while addressing Margaretâ€™s needs.
This redesign ensures Spotify becomes an inclusive platform that empowers seniors to rediscover their love for music seamlessly.
