Our project centers around Brenda Pope, a vibrant 72-year-old retired teacher and lifelong music enthusiast. Brenda, like many members of her generation, cherishes the joy of streaming music on Spotify but often encounters challenges due to its intricate interface. Through engaging user interviews, we uncovered common struggles among older adults, such as recalling song names, and navigating cluttered app designs.

To address these issues, we reimagined Spotify with inclusive, user-friendly features. The "Memory Vault" allows users to tag favorite songs by mood or events, while voice recognition and a unique "humming" feature enable effortless song discovery without needing precise details. Our wireframes showcase a streamlined interface with larger buttons, and decluttered menus, emphasizing simplicity and accessibility. 

Fully 508-compliant, our design ensures inclusivity for users of all abilities. This thoughtful redesign transforms Spotify into a welcoming, empowering platform where Brenda and her peers can rediscover and cherish the music they love.
