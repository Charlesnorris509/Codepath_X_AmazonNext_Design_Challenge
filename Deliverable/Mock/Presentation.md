Spotify Redesign for Senior Users: Accessibility Initiative
Overview
According to 2023 data, users aged 55 and older comprise more than 19% of Spotify's user base. Many of these users experience cognitive and memory-related challenges that affect their ability to fully utilize the platform. This redesign initiative aims to create a more inclusive and accessible experience while maintaining Spotify's core functionality.
Purpose
The primary goal is to enhance Spotify's accessibility for older users, particularly those with cognitive impairments, by implementing memory-supportive features and improving overall usability.
Market Impact

Over 20% of Spotify users are 55+ years old
Many experience memory-related challenges affecting app usage
Addressing accessibility gaps will improve user experience and market presence
